# CHAT-BOT-GEMINI-MODLE-
This project demonstrates a simple text-based AI chatbot built using JavaScript and the Gemini API. The chatbot interacts with users by processing natural language input and returning text-based responses. It's perfect for building virtual assistants, customer support bots, or other applications that require text-based conversations.
